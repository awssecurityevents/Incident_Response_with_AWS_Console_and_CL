# Incident Response with AWS Console and CLI

## Introduction

This hands-on lab will guide you through a number of examples of how you could use the AWS Console and Command Line Interface (CLI) for responding to a security incident. It is a best practice to be prepared for an incident, and have appropriate detective controls enabled. You can find more best practices by reading the [Security Pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.security.en.html).

The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Goals

* Identify tooling for incident response
* Automate containment for incident response
* Pre-deploy tools for incident response
